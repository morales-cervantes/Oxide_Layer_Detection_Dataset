This repository contains the dataset used in the study titled "Real-Time Detection and Monitoring of Oxide Layer Formation in 1045 Steel Using Infrared Thermography and Advanced Image Processing Algorithms." The research focuses on real-time monitoring of oxide layer formation in AISI 1045 steel using infrared thermography.


## Contents

- **Dataset**: The thermographic data captured during the heating of 1045 steel specimens, including annotated images used for analysis. The data is organized into folders corresponding to different experimental conditions.

  - **Folder Structure**:
    - The `Thermographic_Data` folder contains two subfolders named `Barilla_1` and `Barilla_2`, representing the two steel bars from which the specimens were prepared.
    - Inside each of these subfolders, you will find additional subfolders, each corresponding to an individual experiment conducted on a specific specimen.
    - Within each experiment's folder, you will find the thermograms captured during that experiment. The file names of the thermograms include the acquisition time, which varies between 2 seconds and 5 seconds, depending on the experiment.

## Methodology

The dataset comprises thermal images of 1045 steel specimens heated in a controlled environment. The images were annotated to identify regions of oxide layer formation. These annotations were used to evaluate the performance of the image processing algorithms discussed in the study.

## Purpose

This dataset is provided to support further research in the field of infrared thermography and material science. It offers a valuable resource for developing and testing algorithms aimed at detecting and monitoring oxide layer formation in metals.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore the Dataset**: Browse through the `Thermographic_Data` folder to access the thermal images and annotations. The dataset is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding. Each experiment is documented within its respective folder, making it easy to locate specific sets of thermograms.
