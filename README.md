This repository contains the dataset used in the study titled "Real-Time Detection and Monitoring of Oxide Layer Formation in 1045 Steel Using Infrared Thermography and Advanced Image Processing Algorithms." The research focuses on real-time monitoring of oxide layer formation in AISI 1045 steel using infrared thermography.

## Contents

- **Dataset**: The thermographic data captured during the heating of 1045 steel specimens, including annotated images used for analysis. The data is organized into folders corresponding to different experimental conditions.

## Methodology

The dataset comprises thermal images of 1045 steel specimens heated in a controlled environment. The images were annotated to identify regions of oxide layer formation. These annotations were used to evaluate the performance of the image processing algorithms discussed in the study.

## Purpose

This dataset is provided to support further research in the field of infrared thermography and material science. It offers a valuable resource for developing and testing algorithms aimed at detecting and monitoring oxide layer formation in metals.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore the Dataset**: Browse through the folders to access the thermal images and annotations. The dataset is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding.
